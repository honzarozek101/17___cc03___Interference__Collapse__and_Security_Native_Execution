## Overview

This document defines a **security-native execution architecture** where security is
enforced intrinsically through **interference** and **controlled state collapse**.

Disallowed behavior is rendered ineffective or irreversible by execution dynamics,
not blocked by external permission checks.

---

## Core Contributions

- Interference as a first-class control mechanism.
- State collapse as an irreversible security primitive.
- Intrinsic enforcement without privileged control paths.
- Deterministic, auditable security behavior.
- Localized containment and fail-safe bias.

---

## Key Principle

> Security is not permission — it is physics of execution.

---

## Applications

- Secure distributed systems  
- Intrusion-tolerant execution environments  
- Legally auditable security architectures  
- Systems resistant to privilege escalation

---

## Status

Claim-ready, security-focused execution architecture.

---

## Relation to QFC

Defines the **security enforcement layer** of QFC execution semantics.
